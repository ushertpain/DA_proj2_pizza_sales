### DATA VISUALIZATION 
In these steps, I will create some pivot tables and an interactive dashboard. This process is inspired by a YouTuber named Mo Chen. You can watch the video by clicking the image below.

### PIVOT TABLE
I will first create two sheets, namely: Pivot Table and Dashboard. In the Pivot Table sheet, I will proceed to create a pivot table by clicking on the Insert Tab, then selecting the PivotTable icon. Next, I will select all the cells in my Working Sheet.

To address the first question, I will choose 'Month' for Rows and 'Sum of Revenue' for Values from the PivotTable Field. Following this, I will insert a line chart, rename all axes, and customize the number category. It is evident from the graph that there is seasonality, with November showing consistently high trends, reaching a peak of $1.45 million in total revenue.
